In 2010's he collaborated Dmitry Bykov over their project \"Citizen Poet\" (a pun on Nikolai Nekrasov's poem \"Poet and Citizen\"). Yefremov reads poems, written by Bykov, which are usually satirical comments on the contemporary Russian society, politics and culture. Each poem parodies the style of a famous poet of the past, e.g. Pushkin, Nekrasov, Kipling, among others. It was originally broadcast on Dozhd TV channel, but the original project was closed, because the poems were too critical towards Russian government.

The theme song for the game is \"Sweet Home Alabama\" by Lynyrd Skynyrd. It is the fifth game in the NASCAR series of video games, and is the first of the series to have a new title (the other games simply read \"NASCAR\", followed by the year). Notably, it is the first NASCAR game to feature alternate paint schemes on the cars. It featured the 2001 Cup Series Champion Jeff Gordon on its cover and 2000 Cup Series Champion Bobby Labonte on the disc. NASCAR Thunder 2002 was the first NASCAR game released for the Xbox and the second released for the PlayStation 2. Game modes consist of Create-a-car, Quick race, Season mode, Career mode, and practice. Before every race, the player has the option to qualify for a position at the start of the race, get to know the track in practice, or 'race' other cars in Happy Hour. The game has 35 drivers from the 2001 Winston Cup season (minus Dale Earnhardt due to his death, but the game has many tributes to him including a black No. 3 screen on start-up) and several then-Busch Series and fantasy drivers that can be unlocked. The PlayStation 1 edition was separate from the rest, included only 36 drivers, and included an instant-replay feature, fantasy tracks, and only 18 drivers per race, and all of the alternate paint schemes were removed. A system of power-up/cheat cards and challenges, similar to Chase/Thunder plates and Lightning/Dodge Challenges in later editions, was a major game mode in this version.", "passages": [{"passageId": "15796:1015:1265", "exhaustivelyAnnotatedProperties": [{"propertyId": "14", "propertyName": "DATE_OF_DEATH", "propertyDescription": "Describes the date of death of a person."}], "passageStart": 1015, "passageEnd": 1265, "passageText": "The game has 35 drivers from the 2001 Winston Cup season (minus Dale Earnhardt due to his death, but the game has many tributes to him including a black No. 3 screen on start-up) and several then-Busch Series and fantasy drivers that can be unlocked.", "facts": []}]}

He was the last Swedish ruler of Finland, the occupation of which by Russian Czar Alexander I in 1808-09 was the immediate cause of his violent downfall. After an army revolt, the king was seized by officers and forced to relinquish the throne on behalf of his family on March 29, the anniversary of his father's death (due to gunshot wound, in 1792). The Instrument of Government subsequently written was adopted on June 6, the current National Day of Sweden, and was in effect until replaced in 1974. The crown (now with strictly limited powers) passed to his childless uncle, Charles XIII, whose want of heirs set into motion an intense quest for a successor who was found the following year in the person of Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, who assumed the throne in 1818, commencing the present House of Bernadotte.

With a fleet of approximately 45 aircraft, LOT operates a complex network to 60 destinations in Europe, the Middle East, North America, and Asia. Most of the destinations originate from its hub, Warsaw Chopin Airport. As Poland made the transition to a market economy from 1989, LOT began its own transformation from a wholly state-run carrier to a commercial European flag carrier. LOT started a process of fleet renewal with the purchase of Western aircraft to replace its aging Soviet planes. With the arrival of the first Boeing 767-300ER, LOT started inter-continental services to Chicago, Newark, Toronto, and New York City. These four main routes have been some of the most popular flights that LOT operates, especially during the summer season when many Poles and foreigners come to visit Poland either for vacations or to visit their families. LOT found itself undergoing constant management change in the late 2000s due to reductions in market share. In 2012 the company took delivery of one of the most modern aircraft in the world, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, however, after placing orders for several aircraft and taking delivery of two, the carrier found itself \"nearly insolvent\" due to the January 2013 grounding of the Boeing 787. Like other traditional airlines, it offers two service classes on its flights: Economy and Business class.

{"fold": 2, "source": "DBpedia Abstract", "documentId": "8179", "documentText": "Deutschlandlied\n\nThe \"Deutschlandlied\" (English: \"Song of Germany\", [\u02c8d\u0254\u028ft\u0283lant\u02ccli\u02d0t]; also known as \"Das Lied der Deutschen\" or \"The Song of the Germans\"), or part of it, has been the national anthem of Germany since 1922, except in East Germany, whose anthem was \"Auferstanden aus Ruinen\" (\"Risen from Ruins\") from 1949 to 1990. Since World War II and the fall of Nazi Germany, only the third stanza has been used as the national anthem. The stanza's beginning, \"Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit\" (\"Unity and Justice and Freedom\") is considered the unofficial national motto of Germany, and is inscribed on modern German Army belt buckles and the rims of some German coins. The music was written by Austrian composer Joseph Haydn in 1797 as an anthem for the birthday of Francis II, Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire and later of Austria. In 1841, the German linguist and poet August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben wrote the lyrics of \"Das Lied der Deutschen\" to Haydn's melody, lyrics that were considered revolutionary at the time. The song is also well known by the beginning and refrain of the first stanza, \"Deutschland, Deutschland \u00fcber alles\" (\"Germany, Germany above all\"), but this has never been its title. The line \"Germany, Germany above all\" meant that the most important goal of 19th-century German liberal revolutionaries should be a unified Germany which would overcome the perceived anti-liberal ethos of then-fragmented Germany (Kleinstaaterei). Along with the flag of Germany, it was one of the symbols of the March Revolution of 1848.

The Brenta River, which once ran through the city, still touches the northern districts. Its agricultural setting is the Venetian Plain (Pianura Veneta). To the city's south west lies the Euganaean Hills, praised by Lucan and Martial, Petrarch, Ugo Foscolo, and Shelley. It hosts the renowned University of Padua, almost 800 years old, and famous, among other things, for having had Galileo Galilei among its lecturers. The city is picturesque, with a dense network of arcaded streets opening into large communal piazze, and many bridges crossing the various branches of the Bacchiglione, which once surrounded the ancient walls like a moat.

In 1816 he was appointed head of 'antiquarian' collections which later developed into the National Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen. While organizing and classifying the antiquities for exhibition, he decided to present them chronologically according to the three-age system. Other scholars had previously proposed that prehistory had advanced from an age of stone tools, to ages of tools made from bronze and iron, but these proposals were presented as systems of evolution, which did not allow dating of artifacts. Thomsen refined the three-age system as a chronological system by seeing which artifacts occurred with which other artifacts in closed finds. In this way, he was the first to establish an evidence-based division of prehistory into discrete periods. This achievement led to his being credited as the originator of the three-age system of European antiquity. Thomsen also wrote one of the first systematic treatises on gold bracteates of the Migration period. Thomsen's study of artifacts within the Copenhagen museum were based on associations between stylistic change, decoration and context; he recognised the importance of examining objects from \"closed finds\", allowing him to determine the associations of common artifacts for various periods (stone - bronze - iron). His results were published in the Ledetraad til Nordisk Oldkyndighed (Guideline to Scandinavian Antiquity) in 1836.

Sometime between 1915 and 1926, the biscuit was simply named \"Milk-Bone\", owing to the high composition of cow's milk. In 1931, the bakery was acquired by the National Biscuit Company (now Nabisco). The biscuit was the only Bennett product carried over after the acquisition. Over the next few decades, the Milk-Bone was expanded to include a number of different flavors, such as chicken and beef. The marketing focus was also shifted from Milk-Bone being merely a dog treat to a product that promoted cleaner teeth and better breath. Nabisco, under the ownership of Kraft Foods, sold the Milk-Bone rights over to Del Monte Foods of San Francisco, California, in May 2006. The biscuits are made exclusively in Buffalo, New York. A box of Milk-Bone treats makes an early product placement appearance in the 1924 silent film The Tomboy. And it was the basis for one of the most memorable lines from the TV sitcom Cheers, spoken by George Wendt's character Norm: \"It's a dog-eat-dog world and I'm wearing Milk-Bone underwear.\"", "passages": [{"passageId": "18611:48:173", "exhaustivelyAnnotatedProperties": [{"propertyId": "5", "propertyName": "DATE_FOUNDED", "propertyDescription": "Describes the founding date of a company."}], "passageStart": 48, "passageEnd": 173, "passageText": "It was created in 1908 by the F.

He was selected as one of the \"Mercury Seven\" group of military test pilots selected in 1959 by NASA to become America's first astronauts and fly the Project Mercury spacecraft. On February 20, 1962, Glenn flew the Friendship 7 mission and became the first American to orbit the Earth and the fifth person in space, after cosmonauts Yuri Gagarin and Gherman Titov and the sub-orbital flights of Mercury astronauts Alan Shepard and Gus Grissom. Glenn is the earliest-born American to go to orbit, and the second earliest-born man overall after Soviet cosmonaut Georgy Beregovoy. Glenn received the Congressional Space Medal of Honor in 1978, and was inducted into the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame in 1990. With the death of Scott Carpenter on October 10, 2013, Glenn became the last surviving member of the Mercury Seven. Glenn resigned from NASA on January 16, 1964, and the next day announced plans to run for a U.S. Senate seat from Ohio. But injury from a bathtub concussion caused him to withdraw from the race in March. He retired from the Marine Corps on January 1, 1965. A member of the Democratic Party, he finally won election to the Senate in 1974 and served through January 3, 1999. With the death of Edward Brooke on January 3, 2015, Glenn became the oldest living former United States Senator. On October 29, 1998, while still a sitting senator, he became the oldest person to fly in space, and the only one to fly in both the Mercury and Space Shuttle programs, when at age 77, he flew as a Payload Specialist on Discovery mission STS-95.

It is a subsidiary of the Stagecoach Group. It was formed in July 2005 due to the acquisition of Glenvale Transport Limited (GTL), which in turn had initially been formed by ex-MTL managers bidding for company, following a Competition Commission ruling that Arriva must sell their newly acquired Gillmoss depot to preserve the competition within the Merseyside area. The fleet of the newly created Glenvale Transport Limited mostly comprised elderly Leyland Titans and aging Dennis Darts, although efforts were made to update the fleet via an agreement with Essex-based dealer Ensignbus, seeing newer buses arrive regularly from the end of 2003 right up to the Stagecoach takeover in the summer of 2005. Several much newer buses, although in need of repair, were permanently stationed at the depot, likely due to financial struggles making it difficult to repair the buses. Glenvale had an annual turnover of approximately \u00a325 million. The company was sold to Stagecoach Group in 2005, who pledged to invest in new buses for Merseyside. The result since takeover has been a \u00a36.5m fleet of 75 new low-floor Alexander Dennis Dart buses that have entered service with the company, with the sale and disposal of older buses previously in operation with Glenvale. Also, in late January 2013 Stagecoach purchased First's bus operations in Wirral and these now operate as part of Stagecoach Merseyside.", "passages": [{"passageId": "17633:201:523", "exhaustivelyAnnotatedProperties": [{"propertyId": "5", "propertyName": "DATE_FOUNDED", "propertyDescription": "Describes the founding date of a company."}], "passageStart": 201, "passageEnd": 523, "passageText": "It was formed in July 2005 due to the acquisition of Glenvale Transport Limited (GTL), which in turn had initially been formed by ex-MTL managers bidding for company, following a Competition Commission ruling that Arriva must sell their newly acquired Gillmoss depot to preserve the competition within the Merseyside area.", "facts": [{"factId": "17633:201:203:218:227:5", "propertyId": "5", "humanReadable": "<It> <DATE_FOUNDED> <July 2005>", "annotatedPassage": "<It> was formed in <July 2005> due to the acquisition of Glenvale Transport Limited (GTL), which in turn had initially been formed by ex-MTL managers bidding for company, following a Competition Commission ruling that Arriva must sell their newly acquired Gillmoss depot to preserve the competition within the Merseyside area.", "subjectStart": 201, "subjectEnd": 203, "subjectText": "It", "subjectUri": "", "objectStart": 218, "objectEnd": 227, "objectText": "July 2005", "objectUri": ""}]}]}

Soon after, she was appointed Professor of Anatomy at the Academy of Sciences of Bologna Institute. In 1757 Galli was made Professor of Obstetrics at the Bologna Institute in the Palazzo Poggi,and the next year Pope Benedict XIV overrode opposition and established a school of obstetrics at the Institute.The Pope acquired Galli's collection of teaching models for use in the Institute's school.Galli's first twenty models were made by the Manzolinis,and eventually the institute would have over 150 obstetrical models.Galli invented a machine to simulate the birthing process for teaching medical students and midwives.Galli's school was unusual in combining theory and practice in his teaching method,and at that time unusual in teaching the subject in a medical and surgical school.

Polymestor was also a Greek king of Arcadia. During the Trojan War, King Priam was frightened for his youngest son Polydorus's safety since Polydorus could not fight for himself. Priam sent the child, along with gifts of jewelry and gold, to the court of King Polymestor to keep him away from the fighting. After Troy fell, Polymestor betrayed Priam and threw Polydorus into the ocean in order to keep the treasure for himself. Hecuba, Polydorus' mother, found the body and discovered the treachery. She asked Agamemnon to bring Polymestor to her. Agamemnon complied, motivated by the love of Cassandra, another of Hecuba's children. Hecuba baits Polymestor by drawing him in with treasure. Hecuba has the other Trojan women kill Polymestor's sons, and blinds Polymestor by scratching his eyes out. Polymestor is humiliated at having been blinded and made childless at the hands of slave women. Polymestor is given a trial against Hecuba by Agamemnon. Polymestor claims to be working in the Greek's interest by killing Polydorus before he avenges his brothers and father.

Riis was also known as a Hulk Hogan lookalike in the early 1990s, when he presented WWF and WCW on Danish TV channel TV3. Riis created his \"The Great Dane Bear\" character in 1991 and it remains his image to this day. Riis originates from the small island of Mors. His recognizable accent and local jargon made him a fan-favorite, and the subject of many parodies by Danish comedians and entertainers. In the mid-1990s, Riis hosted his own television program on the Danish TV channel TV3, showcasing first WWF Superstars and later, after the World Wrestling Federation, showcased World Championship Wrestling. He was a Danish commentator for wrestling matches, uttering classic phrases such as \"U-behagelig.\" (unpleasant, nasty) and \"Vi m\u00e5 ikke h\u00e5be han har f\u00e5et gule \u00e6rter til aftensmad.\" (Let's hope he hasn't had yellow pea soup for dinner). Riis appeared as himself in a number of Tuborg Squash-commercials, where he jovially beats up two squash-players, while a tune is playing the words \"Du' min aller-bedste Squash-Buddy.\" (You're my very best Squash-Buddy). In 2009 Riis hosted the Danish TV channel 6'eren, presenting \"Friday Fight Night\" a package including wrestling, American Gladiators and action movies. Riis is good friends with fellow Danish actor Sven-Ole Thorsen (longtime friend of Arnold Schwarzenegger). He also had a part in The 13th Warrior, and the cult sci-fi show Captain Power and the Soldiers of the Future. He has run a professional wrestling school in Denmark since 1994, and has produced several local house shows around the country.

Its location is 1.3 miles (2.09 km) from the Abbey Road Studios, where The Beatles recorded. Many well-known people have lived at the address, including a British Member of Parliament, Richard-Hanbury Gurney, and the daughter of the Marquess of Sligo, Lady Emily Charlotte Browne. The square was named after Elizabeth Montagu, who was highly regarded by London society in the late 18th century. Paul McCartney recorded demo songs there, such as \"I'm Looking Through You\", and worked on various compositions, including \"Eleanor Rigby\". With the help of Ian Sommerville he converted the flat to a studio for Apple Corps' avant-garde Zapple label, recording William S. Burroughs for spoken-word Zapple albums. Jimi Hendrix and his manager, Chas Chandler, later lived there with their girlfriends. Whilst living there, Hendrix composed \"The Wind Cries Mary\". For three months, John Lennon and Yoko Ono rented the flat, taking a photograph that would become the cover of their Two Virgins album. After the police raided the flat looking for drugs, the landlord of the property sought an injunction against Starr to prevent it from being used for anything untoward or illegal. Starr sold the lease in February 1969. In 2010, Ono unveiled a blue marker plaque at the site, making it an English Heritage \"building of historical interest\".", "passages": [{"passageId": "4886:878:964", "exhaustivelyAnnotatedProperties": [{"propertyId": "3", "propertyName": "EMPLOYEE_OR_MEMBER_OF", "propertyDescription": "Describes the previous/current employer of a person."}], "passageStart": 878, "passageEnd": 964, "passageText": "Jimi Hendrix and his manager, Chas Chandler, later lived there with their girlfriends.", "facts": []}, {"passageId": "4886:264:451", "exhaustivelyAnnotatedProperties": [{"propertyId": "3", "propertyName": "EMPLOYEE_OR_MEMBER_OF", "propertyDescription": "Describes the previous/current employer of a person."}, {"propertyId": "11", "propertyName": "PLACE_OF_RESIDENCE", "propertyDescription": "Describes the relationship between a person and the location where she/he lives/lived."}], "passageStart": 264, "passageEnd": 451, "passageText": "Many well-known people have lived at the address, including a British Member of Parliament, Richard-Hanbury Gurney, and the daughter of the Marquess of Sligo, Lady Emily Charlotte Browne.", "facts": []}, {"passageId": "4886:31:170", "exhaustivelyAnnotatedProperties": [{"propertyId": "3", "propertyName": "EMPLOYEE_OR_MEMBER_OF", "propertyDescription": "Describes the previous/current employer of a person."}], "passageStart": 31, "passageEnd": 170, "passageText": "34 Montagu Square is the address of a London ground floor and basement flat once leased by Beatles member Ringo Starr during the mid-1960s.", "facts": [{"factId": "4886:137:148:122:129:3", "propertyId": "3", "humanReadable": "<Ringo Starr> <EMPLOYEE_OR_MEMBER_OF> <Beatles>", "annotatedPassage": "34 Montagu Square is the address of a London ground floor and basement flat once leased by <Beatles> member <Ringo Starr> during the mid-1960s.", "subjectStart": 137, "subjectEnd": 148, "subjectText": "Ringo Starr", "subjectUri": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2632", "objectStart": 122, "objectEnd": 129, "objectText": "Beatles", "objectUri": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1299"}]}]}

It has a cage-like fused-ring structure (truncated icosahedron) which resembles a football (soccer ball), made of twenty hexagons and twelve pentagons, with a carbon atom at each vertex of each polygon and a bond along each polygon edge. It was first generated in 1985 by Harold Kroto, James R. Heath, Sean O'Brien, Robert Curl, and Richard Smalley at Rice University. Kroto, Curl and Smalley were awarded the 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their roles in the discovery of buckminsterfullerene and the related class of molecules, the fullerenes. The name is a reference to Buckminster Fuller, as C60 resembles his trademark geodesic domes. Buckminsterfullerene is the most common naturally occurring fullerene molecule, as it can be found in small quantities in soot.Solid and gaseous forms of the molecule have been detected in deep space. Buckminsterfullerene is one of the largest objects to have been shown to exhibit wave\u2013particle duality; as stated in the theory every object exhibits this behavior.

It was released to U.S. radio on June 3, 1991. Three single versions were released: the promo b/w the same song, the 7\" single b/w \"One Part Be My Lover\" a song written by Raitt with her then husband actor Michael O'Keefe, which was also off Luck of the Draw, and a 12\" single with these two songs and \"I Ain\u2019t Gonna Let You Break My Heart Again\" off her previous album Nick of Time. In turn, this song was included on the EP version of Raitt\u2019s 2000 single of \"The Fundamental Things\" taken from her 1998 album Fundamental. It was also included in 2003\u2019s greatest hits compilation The Best of Bonnie Raitt. Live versions also appeared on 1995\u2019s Road Tested and 2006\u2019s Bonnie Raitt and Friends. The song was popular on multiple formats of radio: it peaked at number 5 on Billboard's Adult Contemporary chart, number 12 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock chart, and number 5 on the Billboard Hot 100. It is among one of Bonnie Raitt's most popular songs, along with \"I Can't Make You Love Me\". Raitt won the Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the Grammy Awards of 1992 for her recording of this song (Oleta Adams, Mariah Carey, Amy Grant and Whitney Houston were the other finalists). The track also received a nomination for Record of the Year, losing to \"Unforgettable\" by Nat King Cole and Natalie Cole.

He served as Minority Floor Leader before giving up the post in order to focus more time on the attorney general race. He is married to Katherine Harris and resides in Columbia, Missouri. Harris was born in Columbia and graduated magna cum laude with a B.A. from Vanderbilt University in 1987, and from Cornell University with a J.D. in 1991. He was on the board of editors of the Cornell Law Review while at that school. Following Law School, Jeff practiced in the litigation department of Bryan Cave, LLP, in Kansas City, MO for nine years. In 2001, Jeff took an Assistant Attorney General position with the Missouri Attorney General's office. He was first elected to the Missouri House of Representatives in 2002, and won reelection in 2004 and 2006. The Columbia Tribune observed that Harris's leadership in the House \"allowed him to be one of the chief spokesmen against the Republican majority.\" In 2008 he ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for Missouri Attorney General against fellow state Representative Margaret Donnelly, and State Senator Chris Koster.

Although Sikorski made his MLB debut in 2000, he didn't play another game in the big leagues until 2006. He played professional baseball in Japan for five years, until 2005 for the Yomiuri Giants. The Cleveland Indians acquired Sikorski in a trade July 18, 2006, by sending right-handed pitcher Mike Adams to the San Diego Padres. On May 17, 2007, Sikorski's contract was sold to the Tokyo Yakult Swallows. He signed to play for the Chiba Lotte Marines in 2008. After two more seasons with the Marines, Sikorski signed a contract with the Saitama Seibu Lions to be the team's closer in 2010. Securing the closer spot for the first time in his Japanese career, Sikorski responded, as of August 29, 2010, he leads the Pacific League in saves with 30, and he did not blow a save until August 20 against the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters. Until the 2010 season, Sikorski's record for saves was 15; this was broken on May 25 against the Hiroshima Toyo Carp. Sikorski attended Western Michigan University and obtained a degree in criminology. Brian was drafted in the fourth round of the 1995 amateur entry draft by the Houston Astros. Like many pitchers, Sikorski is known for his strict adherence to his pre-pitching routine. Two of his most noticeable routines are how he vigorously swings his right (pitching) arm in a windmill-style circle, both forwards and backwards before throwing his warmup pitches. Also, after getting the third out of the inning, he sprints off the mound and jumps over the foul line on the way to his team's dugout, resulting in him usually being the first one in.", "passages": [{"passageId": "18655:1070:1153", "exhaustivelyAnnotatedProperties": [{"propertyId": "9", "propertyName": "EDUCATED_AT", "propertyDescription": "Describes the relationship between a person and the institution where she/he studied."}], "passageStart": 1070, "passageEnd": 1153, "passageText": "Sikorski attended Western Michigan University and obtained a degree in criminology.", "facts": [{"factId": "18655:1070:1078:1088:1115:9", "propertyId": "9", "humanReadable": "<Sikorski> <EDUCATED_AT> <Western Michigan University>", "annotatedPassage": "<Sikorski> attended <Western Michigan University> and obtained a degree in criminology.", "subjectStart": 1070, "subjectEnd": 1078, "subjectText": "Sikorski", "subjectUri": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q4965300", "objectStart": 1088, "objectEnd": 1115, "objectText": "Western Michigan University", "objectUri": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1546191"}]}]}

Smith, Jr.\n\nJohn Francis \"Jack\" Smith, Jr. (born April 6, 1938) is the non-executive chairman of the board of directors of Delta Air Lines. Smith has been a member of Delta's board of directors since 2000. From 1996 to 2003, Smith was chairman of the board of directors of General Motors, and was that company's CEO from 1992 to 2000. Smith was born in Worcester, Massachusetts. He joined General Motors as a payroll auditor in 1961, moving to its financial group in New York City in 1966. He went on to hold positions ranging from director of international planning to president of GM Canada, president of GM Europe and head of international operations. As CEO of GM, he undertook one of its most sweeping reorganizations, overturning a cumbersome and inefficient structure created in the 1920s by Alfred P. Sloan and left virtually unchanged since then. Starting with purchasing in 1992 and ending with engineering in 2003, he brought together separate overlapping functions related to the various divisions that formed the company, while also expanding operations into Asia. In this transformation, which included terminating the Oldsmobile brand, over 90% of core management positions were eliminated, corporate decision-making became faster and easier, production efficiencies and quality improved, and, above all, the bottom line went from near-bankruptcy losses to decent profits. After he relinquished the CEO position in 2000 to his personally selected successor, Rick Wagoner, he continued on as Chairman to see his plan fully executed. Along with his chairmanship of Delta, Smith is currently a director of several other entities, including Procter & Gamble and The Nature Conservancy. Smith is a trustee of Boston University.

During the following year, he began clinical work under the psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin and did laboratory work with Franz Nissl and Alois Alzheimer in Munich. In 1911, by way of an invitation from Wilhelm Weygandt, he relocated to Hamburg, where he worked with Theodor Kaes and eventually became head of the laboratory of anatomical pathology at the psychiatric State Hospital Hamburg-Friedrichsberg. Following the death of Kaes in 1913, Jakob succeeded him as prosector. During World War I he served as an army physician in Belgium, and afterwards returned to Hamburg. In 1919 he obtained his habilitation for neurology and in 1924 became a professor of neurology. Under Jakob's guidance the department grew rapidly. He made significant contributions to knowledge on concussion and secondary nerve degeneration and became a doyen of neuropathology. Jakob was the author of five monographs and nearly 80 scientific papers. His neuropathological research contributed greatly to the delineation of several diseases, including multiple sclerosis and Friedreich's ataxia. He first recognised and described Alper's disease and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (named along with Munich neuropathologist Hans Gerhard Creutzfeldt). He gained experience in neurosyphilis, having a 200-bed ward devoted entirely to that disorder. Jakob made a lecture tour of the United States (1924) and South America (1928), of which, he wrote a paper on the neuropathology of yellow fever.

He was a monk in Hitzkirch before becoming the Komtur of Konitz (Chojnice) and advancing in 1277 to the rank of a regional Komtur of Thuringia and Saxony. He became grand master in 1282 or 1283. It was during his term that the political situation of the Kingdom of Jerusalem worsened. This situation was strongly felt by the Order as its headquarters were still in Acre, but despite this, Burchard was in no hurry to help the crusaders in the Middle East, as his mind was preoccupied with matters in Prussia, Livonia, and the Holy Roman Empire. In 1287, a Lithuanian invasion devastated much of Livonia. Burchard left for Rome in 1289 where, in the presence of the Pope, the new borders of the Monastic State of the Teutonic Knights by the Baltic Sea were drawn. Burchard also sought Pope Nicholas IV's permission for the coronation of Rudolf von Habsburg. In early 1290, Burchard was forced by the Order to help the crusaders in Acre which was under siege. An army gathered by the grand master in a hurry left for the Holy Land. Shortly after arriving, Burchard surprisingly handed over his authority to Heinrich von Bonlant, Komtur of Sicily, resigned as the grand master, and left the Order for reasons unknown. After leaving Acre, Burchard left for his native Switzerland where he decided to join the Knights Hospitaller and became the Komtur of Buchsee.

Born in Hamburg, Schleiden was educated at Heidelberg, then practiced law in Hamburg, but soon developed his love for the botany into a full-time pursuit. Schleiden preferred to study plant structure under the microscope. While a professor of botany at the University of Jena, he wrote Contributions to Phytogenesis (1838), in which he stated that the different parts of the plant organism are composed of cells. Thus, Schleiden and Schwann became the first to formulate what was then an informal belief as a principle of biology equal in importance to the atomic theory of chemistry.

In 1906, Ramsay developed \"Kiwi\" brand shoe polish, today one of the most famous shoe polish brands in the world. Born in Glasgow in 1868, Ramsay moved to Australia at the age of ten, settling with his family in Melbourne in June, 1878. The family prospered in Victoria; Ramsay's father, John, was a die-sinker and engraver in Scotland, but became a successful real estate broker in his adopted homeland. After he left school, William Ramsay set up a real estate firm with his father. The business, \"John Ramsay & Son\", prospered. After a trip to New Zealand, where he met and married Annie Elizabeth Meek in Oamaru on 2 January 1901, Ramsay established a factory in Carlton in partnership with Hamilton McKellar. From there, Ramsay & McKellar would produce disinfectants, polishes, creams, and a variety of other products. In 1904 the pair moved the factory to Elizabeth Street, in Melbourne, where, in 1906, they began producing a new shoe polish under the trademark \"Kiwi\". The polish, which would become phenomenally successful in Australia within a few years, was named in honour of Annie Ramsay's New Zealand heritage. In 1912, after McKellar had left the company, Ramsay's father established a branch of Kiwi Polish Co. in London, in the United Kingdom, and in 1913 William Ramsay himself headed to the region to promote the new brand in Europe. Ramsay died of cancer in the family home at Essendon, in Melbourne, outlived by his wife and two sons. His father would follow ten years later.

He attended (at various times) Sul Ross State University, Texas A & M University, the University of Texas at El Paso, the University of Hawaii, the University of Guam, and the University of Rhodesia. Much of his formal education was obtained while on active military duty. Harris spent several decades roaming the world, working at a variety of occupations ranging from farrier to hunting guide to prospector. Such widespread travels presented the opportunity for first-hand interaction with such exotic species as aardwolves, echidnas, and megamouth sharks (these and other creatures later appeared in his syndicated newspaper column, \"Animal Journal\"). He has since returned to his native Southwest, where he lives in an adobe home surrounded by native desert vegetation and wildlife.

The phrase literally means the wise of Provence. In matters of Halacha, as well as in their traditions and custom, the Proven\u00e7al rabbis occupy an intermediate position between the Sephardic tradition of the neighboring Spanish scholars, and the Old French (similar to the Ashkenazic) tradition represented by the Tosafists. The term \"Provence\" in Jewish tradition is not limited to today's administrative region of Provence but refers to the whole of Occitania. This includes Narbonne (which is sometimes informally, though incorrectly, transliterated as \"Narvona\" as a result of the back-and-forth transliteration between Hebrew and French), Lunel (which is informally transliterated as \"Lunil\"), and the city of Montpellier, not far (7 km) from the mediterranean coast. It also included cities which at that time formed part of the Catalan political and cultural domain, such as Perpignan. In some ways the Jewish traditions of Catalonia were closer to those of Provence than to those of Castile and southern Spain. There was a distinctive Proven\u00e7al liturgy, used by the Jews of the Papal enclave of Comtat Venaissin, who remained following the expulsion of the Jews from the rest of France. This liturgy was intermediate in character between the Sephardi and Ashkenazi rites, and was in some ways closer to the Italian rite than to either.

Their longtime mascot was a bantam, called Brewster Rooster, who wore attire with Goebel's logo, and the beer was a long-time sponsor of Detroit Tigers baseball broadcasts on radio. Prohibition forced the closure of the brewery in 1920 though the space was rented out to various industries. In 1932 the company was reorganized. Though Prohibition was repealed in 1933 the brewery would not begin new production until the Spring of 1934. Otto Rosenbusch, the retired brewmaster from Stroh Brewery Company, was brought on to help Goebel compete against his old employer at Stroh's and his son Herman who was the head brewer there. Upon the elder Rosenbusch's passing in 1935, Charles Elich, the brewmaster at the Pabst Brewing Company agreed to become both the brewmaster and superintendent at Goebel.

(21 February 1801 \u2013 11 August 1890), also referred to as Cardinal Newman, John Henry Cardinal Newman, and Blessed John Henry Newman, was an important figure in the religious history of England in the 19th century. He was known nationally by the mid-1830s. Originally an evangelical Oxford University academic and priest in the Church of England, Newman then became drawn to the high-church tradition of Anglicanism. He became known as a leader of, and an able polemicist for, the Oxford Movement, an influential and controversial grouping of Anglicans who wished to return to the Church of England many Catholic beliefs and liturgical rituals from before the English Reformation. In this the movement had some success. However, in 1845 Newman, joined by some but not all of his followers, left the Church of England and his teaching post at Oxford University and was received into the Catholic Church. He was quickly ordained as a priest and continued as an influential religious leader, based in Birmingham. In 1879, he was created a cardinal by Pope Leo XIII in recognition of his services to the cause of the Catholic Church in England. He was instrumental in the founding of the Catholic University of Ireland, which evolved into University College, Dublin, today the largest university in Ireland. Newman's beatification was officially proclaimed by Pope Benedict XVI on 19 September 2010 during his visit to the United Kingdom. His canonisation is dependent on the documentation of additional miracles attributed to his intercession. Newman was also a literary figure of note: his major writings including the Tracts for the Times (1833\u20131841), his autobiography Apologia Pro Vita Sua (1865\u201366), the Grammar of Assent (1870), and the poem The Dream of Gerontius (1865), which was set to music in 1900 by Edward Elgar.

Since the 1960s Kripke has been a central figure in a number of fields related to mathematical logic, philosophy of language, philosophy of mathematics, metaphysics, epistemology, and set theory. Much of his work remains unpublished or exists only as tape recordings and privately circulated manuscripts. Kripke was the recipient of the 2001 Schock Prize in Logic and Philosophy. A 2009 academic poll ranked Kripke among the top ten most important philosophers of the past 200 years. Kripke has made influential and original contributions to logic, especially modal logic. His work has profoundly influenced analytic philosophy, with his principal contribution being a semantics for modal logic, involving possible worlds as described in a system now called Kripke semantics. Another of his most important contributions is his argument that necessity is a 'metaphysical' notion, which should be separated from the epistemic notion of a priori, and that there are necessary truths which are a posteriori truths, such as \"Water is H2O.\" He has also contributed an original reading of Wittgenstein, referred to as \"Kripkenstein.\" His most famous work is Naming and Necessity (1980).", "passages": [{"passageId": "5291:113:241", "exhaustivelyAnnotatedProperties": [{"propertyId": "3", "propertyName": "EMPLOYEE_OR_MEMBER_OF", "propertyDescription": "Describes the previous/current employer of a person."}], "passageStart": 113, "passageEnd": 241, "passageText": "He is a Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at the City University of New York and emeritus professor at Princeton University.", "facts": [{"factId": "5291:113:115:166:193:3", "propertyId": "3", "humanReadable": "<He> <EMPLOYEE_OR_MEMBER_OF> <City University of New York>", "annotatedPassage": "<He> is a Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at the <City University of New York> and emeritus professor at Princeton University.", "subjectStart": 113, "subjectEnd": 115, "subjectText": "He", "subjectUri": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q298521", "objectStart": 166, "objectEnd": 193, "objectText": "City University of New York", "objectUri": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q762266"}, {"factId": "5291:113:115:220:240:3", "propertyId": "3", "humanReadable": "<He> <EMPLOYEE_OR_MEMBER_OF> <Princeton University>", "annotatedPassage": "<He> is a Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at the City University of New York and emeritus professor at <Princeton University>.", "subjectStart": 113, "subjectEnd": 115, "subjectText": "He", "subjectUri": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q298521", "objectStart": 220, "objectEnd": 240, "objectText": "Princeton University", "objectUri": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q21578"}]}]}

It was formed in 1997 as a fully owned subsidiary of Telkom Kenya. In May 2000, Vodafone Group PLC of the United Kingdom acquired a 40% stake and management responsibility for the company. On 28th February 2018, Safaricom changed its name in compliance with section 53 of the Companies Act, 2015. The company will now be Safaricom PLC instead of Safaricom Limited with effect from January 31, 2018. As of December 2, 2016, Bob Collymore was the CEO; he succeeded Michael Joseph on November 1, 2010, after Joseph's ten years as Safaricom CEO. Collymore has spent most of his career in the telecommunications industry starting with British Telecommunications, where he held a number of marketing, purchasing and commercial roles over a 15-year period. Recent reports appearing in the cross section of the press indicate that Vodafone Plc of UK only owns 35% and the remaining 5% is owned by a little-known company, Mobitelea Ventures Limited. The reports have caused a stir which led to the summoning of its CEO Michael Joseph to appear before the PIC \"Public Investment Committee\", during which he denied knowing who the other shareholder is.

It is one of the world's most famous paintings. The work is presumed to have been commenced around 1495 and was commissioned as part of a plan of renovations to the church and its convent buildings by Leonardo's patron Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan. The painting represents the scene of The Last Supper of Jesus with his disciples, as it is told in the Gospel of John, 13:21. Leonardo has depicted the consternation that occurred among the Twelve Disciples when Jesus announced that one of them would betray him.

He is the son of Poseidon and Amphitrite, god and goddess of the sea respectively, and is herald for his father. He is usually represented as a merman, having the upper body of a human and the tail of a fish, \"sea-hued\", according to Ovid \"his shoulders barnacled with sea-shells\". Like his father, Poseidon, he carried a trident. However, Triton's special attribute was a twisted conch shell, on which he blew like a trumpet to calm or raise the waves. Its sound was such a cacophony, that when loudly blown, it put the giants to flight, who imagined it to be the roar of a dark wild beast. According to Hesiod's Theogony, Triton dwelt with his parents in a golden palace in the depths of the sea; Homer places his seat in the waters off Aegae.[disambiguation needed] The story of the Argonauts places his home on the coast of Libya. When the Argo was driven ashore in the Gulf of Syrtes Minor, the crew carried the vessel to the \"Tritonian Lake\", Lake Tritonis, whence Triton, the local deity euhemeristically rationalized by Diodorus Siculus as \"then ruler over Libya\", welcomed them with a guest-gift of a clod of earth and guided them through the lake's marshy outlet back to the Mediterranean. When the Argonauts were lost in the desert, he guided them to find the passage from the river back to the sea. Triton was the father of Pallas and foster parent to the goddess Athena. Pallas was killed by Athena accidentally during a sparring fight between the two goddesses. Triton can sometimes be multiplied into a host of Tritones, daimones of the sea. In the Virgil's Aeneid, book 6, it is told that Triton killed Misenus, son of Aeolus, by drowning him after he challenged the gods to play as well as he did.", "passages": [{"passageId": "8819:1428:1500", "exhaustivelyAnnotatedProperties": [{"propertyId": "34", "propertyName": "CHILD_OF", "propertyDescription": "Describes the relationship between a person and his/her parent."}], "passageStart": 1428, "passageEnd": 1500, "passageText": "Triton was the father of Pallas and foster parent to the goddess Athena.", "facts": [{"factId": "8819:1453:1459:1428:1434:34", "propertyId": "34", "humanReadable": "<Pallas> <CHILD_OF> <Triton>", "annotatedPassage": "<Triton> was the father of <Pallas> and foster parent to the goddess Athena.", "subjectStart": 1453, "subjectEnd": 1459, "subjectText": "Pallas", "subjectUri": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2276869", "objectStart": 1428, "objectEnd": 1434, "objectText": "Triton", "objectUri": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q148030"}]}]}

They were managed by Jim Williams and played its home games at the Estadio BR Julio Hern\u00e1ndez Molina in Acarigua, Portuguesa. This team was created by the temporary merger of two VPBL teams, the Tiburones de La Guaira and the Leones del Caracas, at the end of the 1974\u20131975 season. By then, the Tiburones and Leones management had a contract dispute with the Central University of Venezuela, owners of the Estadio Universitario in Caracas, which was shared by both teams. As a result, both teams moved out of Caracas and temporarily merged their operations into a single team, a curious development, since the two teams were historically bitter rivals of the fan base who settled in the same area. Meanwhile, fans in La Guaira and Caracas cities loathed the Tibuleones nickname to identify the new squad, which is a reminiscent of the ludicrous 1914\u20131915 Federal League nicknames (Buf-Feds) and the National Football League (Card-Pitt) monikers during World War II conflict. The Tibuleones sobriquet derived from the Tiburones (Sharks) and Leones (Lions) words, creating a term that could be translated as Sharklions. The team finished second with a 33-31 record, four games behind regular-season winner Cardenales de Lara, but was swept by the Tigres de Aragua, 4\u20130, in the first round playoff series. After that, the Tiburones and Leones teams reached an agreement with the CUV and returned to the Estadio Universitario the following season.", "passages": [{"passageId": "24034:633:858", "exhaustivelyAnnotatedProperties": [{"propertyId": "11", "propertyName": "PLACE_OF_RESIDENCE", "propertyDescription": "Describes the relationship between a person and the location where she/he lives/lived."}], "passageStart": 633, "passageEnd": 858, "passageText": "As a result, both teams moved out of Caracas and temporarily merged their operations into a single team, a curious development, since the two teams were historically bitter rivals of the fan base who settled in the same area.", "facts": []}]}
